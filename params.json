These tools were originally designed to [construct] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19855814) [3D connectomics volumes] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21311605) from terabytes of image data for the [Marc lab] (http://marclab.org) at the University of Utah Moran Eye Center.\r\n\r\n### Package overview\r\n\r\nConstruction of a volume is handled by the [nornir-buildmanager] (https://github.com/nornir/nornir-buildmanager/wiki).  This produces a set of images and transforms on disk which can be accessed via [Viking] (http://connectomes.utah.edu/), HTTP, or written as a stack of images.\r\n\r\nManual corrections of section-to-section alignment within a volume is handled by [Pyre] (https://github.com/jamesra/nornir-pyre/wiki)\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the annotations in our existing rabbit connectome and future connectomes is performed by the [py-connectome-analysis] (https://github.com/jamesra/py-connectome-analysis/wiki) package.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe [wiki] (http://github.com/nornir/nornir-buildmanager/wiki) contains documentation for installation and use","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
